The amount and consistency of the discharge can vary based on your menstrual cycle, sexual activity, and overall health.</p><p>In summary, white residue on your underwear is most likely caused by vaginal discharge, which is a normal bodily function that helps keep your vagina clean and healthy.</p><p><h2>Understanding the Different Types of Vaginal Discharge</h2></p><p>As mentioned earlier, vaginal discharge is a normal and healthy bodily function.

Yellow or Green Discharge</h3></p><p>This type of discharge is usually a sign of an infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. It may also have a foul odor and be accompanied by itching and burning. If you notice this type of discharge, it's important to see your doctor for treatment.</p><p><h3>4. Brown or Bloody Discharge</h3></p><p>This type of discharge may occur at the beginning or end of your period. It may also occur during ovulation or due to hormonal changes.

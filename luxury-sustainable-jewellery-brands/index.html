This California-based brand is committed to using only ethically sourced materials and fair trade practices in their production.</p><p>They also have a unique business model - they sell their pieces directly to consumers, cutting out the middleman and reducing costs. This allows them to offer high-quality pieces at a lower price point.</p><p>But what we love most about Vrai & Oro is their commitment to transparency. They share all of their production costs and markups on their website, so customers can see exactly where their money is going.</p><h3>A Guide to Shopping Sustainably</h3><p>If you're new to shopping sustainably, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.

Consider the brand's commitment to sustainability and ethical practices.</p><p>3. Choose high-quality pieces that are made to last.</p><p>4. Consider purchasing from brands that offer transparency about their production costs and markups.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Are luxury sustainable jewellery brands more expensive than traditional jewellery brands?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> While some luxury sustainable jewellery brands can be more expensive than traditional brands, it's important to remember that you're investing in high-quality pieces that are made to last. Additionally, by reducing the need for constant replacement, you can actually save money in the long run.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any sustainable jewellery brands that use diamonds?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there are sustainable jewellery brands that use ethically sourced diamonds, such as Vrai & Oro and Brilliant Earth.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I ensure that a brand is truly sustainable?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Look for brands that are transparent about their production processes and materials.

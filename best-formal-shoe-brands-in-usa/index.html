In this guide, we'll introduce you to some of the best formal shoe brands in USA, helping you make an informed decision on your next purchase.</p><p><h2>Allen Edmonds</h2></p><p>If you're looking for top-quality dress shoes, Allen Edmonds is a brand you can't ignore. Established in Wisconsin in 1922, this brand has been producing high-quality leather shoes for nearly a century. Allen Edmonds shoes are known for their durability, timeless style, and the fact that they're made in the USA.</p><p>I personally have a pair of Allen Edmonds Park Avenues that I wear to work regularly. They are comfortable, stylish, and have held up well over the years. The only downside is that they can be a bit pricey, but the investment is definitely worth it if you're looking for a shoe that will last you a long time.</p><p><h2>Cole Haan</h2></p><p>If you're looking for a more modern take on formal footwear, Cole Haan is a great option. This brand combines traditional craftsmanship with innovative design, resulting in shoes that are both stylish and comfortable.</p><p>I recently purchased a pair of Cole Haan oxfords for a wedding, and they were a hit. Not only did they look great with my suit, but they were comfortable enough to wear all night without any discomfort.</p><p><h3>Johnston & Murphy</h3></p><p>Johnston & Murphy is another brand that has been producing high-quality shoes for over a century. Founded in 1850, this brand has a long history of producing shoes that are both stylish and durable.</p><p>One of the things I love about Johnston & Murphy is their wide range of styles. Whether you're looking for a classic oxford or a more modern loafer, they have something for everyone. They also offer a variety of widths, making it easier to find a shoe that fits well.</p><p><h4>How to Choose the Best Formal Shoe Brands in USA</h4></p><p>When it comes to choosing the best formal shoe brands in USA, there are a few things you should keep in mind.

However, Canadian interior designers can expect to make a median salary of around $50,000 per year, according to PayScale. Factors such as experience, education, location, and employer can impact an interior designer's salary.</p><p>In summary, while the salary for interior designers in Canada can vary widely, the median annual salary is approximately $50,000.

Having a degree has opened up more opportunities for me and has allowed me to take on more significant projects that pay better.</p><p><h2>Location</h2></p><p>The location of an interior designer also affects their salary. Interior designers working in major cities, such as Toronto or Vancouver, generally earn higher salaries than those working in smaller cities or rural areas. This is because living expenses are higher in bigger cities, and the cost of living is reflected in salaries.</p><p>When I moved from a small town to Toronto, I noticed a significant increase in my salary. However, it's worth noting that the cost of living in Toronto is much higher than in smaller towns, so it's essential to consider living expenses when comparing salaries in different locations.</p><p><h3>Employer</h3></p><p>The employer an interior designer works for can also affect their salary. Interior designers working for large design firms or corporations generally earn more than those working for small businesses or as self-employed designers. Design firms and corporations typically have more significant budgets and can pay higher salaries.</p><p>Personally, I have worked for both a small design firm and a large corporation. While I enjoyed the more personalized experience of working for a small business, the larger corporation paid me a higher salary and had more benefits.</p><p><h4>How to Increase Your Salary as an Interior Designer in Canada</h4></p><p>If you're an interior designer in Canada looking to increase your salary, there are a few things you can do. Firstly, you can gain more experience and education. Consider pursuing a master's degree or taking on larger projects to gain more experience.

The bag was inspired by the shape of a saddle and was designed to be practical, durable, and stylish. The bamboo handle was not only a unique and eye-catching design feature, but it was also practical, as it was lightweight, strong, and easy to grip. The bag quickly became a hit with fashionistas and celebrities alike, and it remains an iconic piece to this day.</p><p>In summary, the first Gucci product ever created was a leather bag with a bamboo handle, which was launched in 1947.

Understanding the clothing of these individuals can provide insight into their social status, cultural norms, and daily lives.The clothing of ancient Chinese merchants was designed to be practical, reflecting their need for comfort and mobility while conducting business. However, it also served as a means of showcasing their wealth and status, with finer fabrics and more intricate designs reserved for those who were more affluent.Ancient Chinese merchants typically wore loose-fitting clothing that allowed for ease of movement, such as robes and tunics. These garments were made from silk or cotton, with silk being the preferred fabric for those who could afford it. Merchants would often wear several layers of clothing to protect themselves from the elements, with a robe as the outermost layer.In addition to clothing, ancient Chinese merchants also accessorized with various items that served practical purposes.

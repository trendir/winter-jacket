The most popular styles include the sherwani, achkan, and bandhgala. Each of these styles has its unique features and can be customized to suit the groom's personal style.</p><p>Personally, I opted for a sherwani for my wedding. The sherwani is a long coat-like garment that is typically worn over a kurta and churidar. It is adorned with intricate embroidery and embellishments that add a touch of elegance to the outfit.

However, in recent times, grooms are opting for bolder colors like red, blue or green.</p><p><h3>Accessories to Complete the Look</h3></p><p>To complete the perfect men's wedding dress Indian, accessories are essential. A turban or safa is a traditional accessory that adds a touch of elegance to the outfit. It is usually made with the same fabric as the wedding dress and is adorned with embellishments. Other accessories like a pocket square, watch, and cufflinks can also be added to complete the look.</p><p><h4>How to Choose the Perfect Fit</h4></p><p>Choosing the right fit for your men's wedding dress Indian is crucial for a comfortable and elegant look. The outfit should be tailored to fit your body type and personal style. The sherwani or achkan should fit snugly around the shoulders and chest, with the sleeves ending at the wrist bone. The length of the outfit should be appropriate for your height, and the pants should fit comfortably around the waist and hips.</p><p><h2>Accessorizing Your Men's Wedding Dress Indian</h2></p><p>Accessories are an essential part of any men's wedding dress Indian. Personally, I added a turban and a pocket square to complete my look. The turban was made with the same fabric as my sherwani and was adorned with an embellished brooch.

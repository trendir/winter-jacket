It is exciting to watch two fighters go toe to toe, trading blows, trying to outsmart each other, and ultimately trying to knock their opponent out. The lightweight division has always been one of the most exciting divisions in boxing, and 2021 is no exception. Fans are eagerly waiting to see who will emerge as the best lightweight boxer of 2021.</p><p>The question of who is the best lightweight boxer 2021 is a topic that has been discussed among boxing fans for quite some time now. There are different opinions on who the best lightweight boxer is, and it all depends on various factors such as the fighter's record, their fighting style, their level of competition, and their recent performances.</p><p>In our opinion, the best lightweight boxer of 2021 is Teofimo Lopez. He is the current unified lightweight world champion and has a record of 16-0 with 12 knockouts. He defeated Vasiliy Lomachenko, who was considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, to become the undisputed lightweight champion. Lopez is an explosive fighter with incredible power and speed, and he has shown that he can compete at the highest level.</p><p>In summary, the best lightweight boxer of 2021 is Teofimo Lopez. He has proven himself to be a dominant force in the lightweight division, and we look forward to seeing him defend his titles against other top fighters in the division.</p><p><h2>Teofimo Lopez: A Personal Experience</h2></p><p>I have been a big fan of Teofimo Lopez since he burst onto the scene in 2016. I was impressed with his speed and power, and I knew that he had the potential to be a world champion. I followed his career closely, and I was thrilled when he defeated Richard Commey to become the IBF lightweight champion.</p><p>When he faced Vasiliy Lomachenko in October 2020, I knew it was going to be a tough fight. Lomachenko was considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, and he had an incredible record of 14-1. However, Lopez showed that he was up for the challenge. He dominated the fight and won a unanimous decision, becoming the undisputed lightweight champion in the process.</p><p>Lopez is a fighter who has a lot of potential, and I believe that he will continue to dominate the lightweight division in 2021 and beyond. He has the skills, the power, and the speed to be one of the greatest fighters of all time.</p><p><h2>The Rise of Ryan Garcia</h2></p><p>Ryan Garcia is a young fighter who has been making waves in the lightweight division. He has a record of 21-0 with 18 knockouts and has been touted as the next big thing in boxing. Garcia has a lot of potential, and he has shown that he has the skills to compete at the highest level.</p><p>In January 2021, Garcia faced Luke Campbell in a highly anticipated fight. It was a tough fight for Garcia, but he showed that he had the heart and determination to come out on top. He knocked out Campbell in the seventh round, cementing his status as one of the best fighters in the lightweight division.</p><p>Garcia is still young, and he has a lot to prove. However, he has shown that he has the potential to be a world champion, and we look forward to seeing him take on other top fighters in the division.</p><p><h3>The Importance of Fighting Styles in Boxing</h3></p><p>When it comes to boxing, fighting style is an essential factor to consider. Different fighters have different styles, and it all depends on their strengths and weaknesses. In the lightweight division, there are different fighting styles that fighters use to gain an advantage over their opponents.</p><p>Teofimo Lopez is an explosive fighter who relies on his power and speed to overwhelm his opponents. He has a lot of knockout power, and he is not afraid to take risks in the ring. Ryan Garcia, on the other hand, is a more technical fighter who relies on his speed and accuracy to outpoint his opponents. He has excellent footwork and is always looking for openings to land his shots.</p><p>When it comes to the best lightweight boxer of 2021, fighting style is an essential factor to consider. Lopez's explosive style has proven to be successful, but it also leaves him open to counterattacks. Garcia's technical style allows him to outpoint his opponents, but he may struggle against fighters who are more aggressive.</p><p><h4>How to Watch the Best Lightweight Boxers in 2021</h4></p><p>If you want to watch the best lightweight boxers in 2021, there are several options available to you.

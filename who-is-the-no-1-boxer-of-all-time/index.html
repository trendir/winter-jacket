He was also a master of defense and was able to dodge punches with ease.</p><p>What sets Robinson apart from other boxers is his ability to adapt to any situation. He was able to switch from being an aggressive fighter to a defensive one depending on the situation. He was also able to fight at multiple weight classes, winning titles in both middleweight and welterweight divisions.</p><p><h3>The Legacy of Rocky Marciano</h3></p><p>Rocky Marciano is another boxer who is often mentioned as one of the greatest of all time. He was the only heavyweight champion to retire undefeated, with a record of 49 wins and no losses.</p><p>Marciano was known for his incredible power and ability to knock out his opponents. He was also a master of defense and was able to take a punch. His fights against Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott are still considered some of the greatest moments in boxing history.</p><p><h4>How to Determine the Greatest Boxer of All Time</h4></p><p>Determining the greatest boxer of all time is subjective and depends on personal opinions. However, there are a few factors that most people consider when making their decision.</p><p>These factors include the boxer's record, the level of competition they faced, their style of fighting, and their impact on the sport.

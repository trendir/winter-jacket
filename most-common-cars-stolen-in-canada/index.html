Not only do you lose your valuable possession, but the process of filing an insurance claim and getting a replacement car can be time-consuming and stressful. In this article, we will discuss the most common cars stolen in Canada and provide tips on how to prevent car theft.</p><p>Car theft is a widespread problem in Canada, with thousands of vehicles being stolen every year. According to statistics, car theft happens every 7 minutes in Canada. While car theft can happen to any car, some models are more likely to be stolen than others.</p><p>The target of this article is to provide information on the most common cars stolen in Canada and how car owners can protect their cars from theft.</p><p>In summary, this article will cover the following points:</p><ul><li>What are the most common cars stolen in Canada?</li><li>Why are these cars targeted?</li><li>How can you protect your car from theft?</li><li>What should you do if your car is stolen?</li></ul><p><h2>Most Common Cars Stolen in Canada</h2></p><p>I have a personal experience of a friend who had his car stolen. He owned a 2017 Honda Civic, which is one of the most commonly stolen cars in Canada. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the following are the top 10 most frequently stolen cars in Canada:</p><ol><li>2017 Honda CR-V</li><li>2018 Lexus RX350/RX450h</li><li>2017 Honda Civic</li><li>2018 Honda CR-V</li><li>2018 Toyota Highlander</li><li>2017 Toyota Highlander</li><li>2019 Honda CR-V</li><li>2019 Lexus RX350/RX450h</li><li>2017 Dodge/RAM Ram Pickup</li><li>2018 Toyota RAV4</li></ol><p><h2>Why Are These Cars Targeted?</h2></p><p>There are several reasons why these cars are targeted. Firstly, they are popular models that are in high demand, making them easier to sell in the black market. Secondly, they are often equipped with keyless entry systems, which can make them vulnerable to hacking and theft. Lastly, some models may have weaker anti-theft systems or lack modern security features, making them easier to steal.</p><p><h2>How Can You Protect Your Car from Theft?</h2></p><p>Fortunately, there are several ways you can protect your car from theft. Firstly, you should always lock your car and keep the windows closed. Secondly, you should avoid leaving your car keys in the car or in an easily accessible area. Thirdly, you can install an anti-theft device, such as a steering wheel lock, an alarm system, or a GPS tracker. Lastly, you should park your car in a well-lit area and avoid leaving it in isolated or high-crime areas.</p><p><h2>What Should You Do If Your Car Is Stolen?</h2></p><p>If your car is stolen, you should file a police report immediately and contact your insurance company to report the theft. You should also provide the police and your insurance company with as much information as possible, including the make, model, and license plate number of your car. If you have installed a GPS tracker, you may be able to track the whereabouts of your car and help the police recover it.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can I prevent car theft by removing the license plates?</strong></p><p>A: While removing the license plates may make your car less attractive to thieves, it is not a foolproof way to prevent car theft. Thieves can still target your car based on its make and model, and they can easily replace the license plates with fake ones.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I save money on my car insurance if I install an anti-theft device?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, many insurance companies offer discounts for installing anti-theft devices in your car. However, the discount may vary depending on the type of device and the insurance company.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I report my car stolen if I lent it to a friend and they have not returned it?</strong></p><p>A: No, you cannot report your car stolen if you lent it to someone and they have not returned it. However, you can report it as a missing vehicle and provide the police with your friend's information.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I still file an insurance claim if my car is recovered after it was stolen?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can still file an insurance claim if your car is recovered after it was stolen. However, you should notify your insurance company as soon as possible and provide them with the necessary documents and information.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Most Common Cars Stolen in Canada</h2></p><p>Car theft is a serious problem in Canada, and it can happen to any car owner. By being aware of the most commonly stolen cars in Canada and taking precautions to protect your car, you can reduce the risk of theft and ensure that you are prepared in case your car is stolen. Remember to always lock your car, avoid leaving your keys in the car, and install an anti-theft device if possible. Stay safe and protect your car!</p></article>

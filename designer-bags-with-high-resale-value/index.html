This tote bag has been a customer favorite for years, thanks to its spacious interior and versatile design. The Neverfull comes in a variety of materials and prints, but the classic monogram canvas is the most popular.</p><p>I personally love my Louis Vuitton Neverfull for travel and work. It's roomy enough to hold all my essentials, but still looks chic and stylish. When shopping for a Neverfull, look for one in good condition with minimal signs of wear. And keep in mind that the monogram canvas version holds its value better than other materials.</p><h3>Hermès Birkin</h3><p>The Hermès Birkin is one of the most iconic bags in the world, and it's no surprise that it has high resale value.
